Collection of helpers to aid in reactive template programming with Ember.js.

## Introduction

Reactive helpers are helpers that return functions. These functions can be bound to event handlers 
to process data on the way up in the Data Down Actions Up cycle. `r` helper makes it possible to use
[`ember-composable-helpers`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers) in event handlers where execution of the helper is delayed until event is triggered.

## Helpers

### `(r helper [arg1 arg2 ...])`

Returns a function for a given helper and curry arguments to it.

```hbs
<input value={{value}} oninput={{action (pipe (r 'dasherize') (action (mut value))) value="target.value"}}
```

`r` helper accepts functions as helpers. For example, lets say you have a method on the context called `addNumbers`

```js
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  addNumbers([a, b]) {
    return a + b;
  }
});
```

You can use it in the template.

```hbs
<button {{action (pipe (r addNumbers 1) (action (mut count))) count}}>+1</button>
```

### `(r/get propName)`

`(r/get)` helper returns a function. When called, the function will return value taken from object that it receives as first argument at property propName.

```hbs
{{compute (r/get 'animal') (hash animal='cat')}} {{! //=> cat }}
```

### `(r/param [index])`

`(r/param)` return a function. When called, this function will return received argument at specified index.

```hbs
{{compute (r/param) 'hello' 'world'}} {{! //=> 'hello'}}
{{compute (r/param 1) 'hello' 'world'}} {{! //=> 'world'}}
```
### `(r/debugger)`

`(r/debugger)` will create a helper that will inject a debugger breakpoint into a helper pipe. It will pass through the value,
that's passed into the helper.

```hbs
<button {{action (pipe (some-helper) (r/debugger) (some-other-helper))}}>Do!</button>
```

### `(r/log ['your message'])`

`(r/log)` helper will evaluate to a function. When called, this function will log the passed in messsage and arguments that it received.

```hbs
<button {{action (pipe (r/log 'before save') (action 'save') (r/log 'after save')) model}}>Save</button>
```

### `(r/tap value)`

`(r/tap value)` helper will evaluate to a function that'll return the passed in argument. 

### `{{shhh anything}}`

`{{shhh` helper will supress any output that's passed into it. This is useful when you want to compute a helper 
without having it's output rendered.

### `(transition-to 'destination' model (query-params foo='bar'))`

`(transition-to)` helper the same argument signature as `link-to` but evaluates to an action that can be called to trigger transition.

```hbs
<button {{action (transtion-to 'index')}}>Go to Index</button>
```
